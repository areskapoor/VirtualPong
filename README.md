**VirtualPong** is a virtual water pong simulation powered by **OpenCV**, tracking the player's hand movements using a stereo camera system to accurately portray the desired movement. The final positioning of the ball is calculated from the change in x and velocity taken from the cameras working with OpenCV. The graphical elements are simulated using **vpython**, modeling the 3D demonstration of a pong table on a virtual environment.
